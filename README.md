# embedding-projector-standalone

LIVE VERSION : https://justingosses.github.io/embedding-projector-standalone/

Stood up while trying to get a github pages page with embedding projector up for <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/geoVec-playground">this repo</a> but it wouldn't work and git stopped recognizing LFS sadly.
